# Milestone 3

### Writeup

We have our UI skeletons mainly through the Add item and Checkout Item skeletons. Previously in milestone 2, our app could only add and checkout items by manually inputting in the Item's name, barcode, amount and units. Now we have started to implement the UPC lookup functionality. The UI skeleton for add item includes two options, a choice for the user to manually input in the information or a choice to use the UPC lookup. For the manual entry page, we kept the functionality mostly similar to milestone two where you could enter in the item name, barcode and number amount. However, we have changed the units entry to be a wheel selection, so that instead of having the user type out their specific units of measurement, they just simply have to choose which one through the wheel, which would lower user entry errors. For the UPC lookup page, we have a simple item barcode where the user types in an item's barcode and it will look up the item and add it into the list. We also changed checkout's UI skeleton by having just the item name look up and the unit.
